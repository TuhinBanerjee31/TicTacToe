# Lessons Learned

During the development of this application, I honed my skills in managing state with arrays and boolean values using useState. I deepened my understanding of when to employ conditional rendering and how to integrate icons into applications using the 'react-native-vector-icons' npm package. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing sound effects using the 'react-native-sound' package.
